# Drink Water API

The Drink Water API provides a robust set of RESTful endpoints that power the core of the hydration monitoring platform.
This API enables client applications to track and record users' water intake, manage personalized hydration goals, and
access detailed consumption analytics. Built with Spring Boot and integrated with Keycloak for secure authentication,
the API delivers capabilities for user profile management, daily goal settings based on individual characteristics, and
generation of customized hydration reports.

The API offers a comprehensive suite of endpoints for:

- User profile management with secure authentication through Keycloak
- Daily water intake tracking with timestamp precision
- Customizable hydration goals based on user attributes
- Historical data retrieval with flexible date range filtering
- Analytics generation for tracking hydration patterns
- Notification preference management for client applications

This backend service is designed with scalability in mind, implementing caching strategies, database optimization, and
containerization support through Docker. The API follows REST best practices, providing clear documentation through
Swagger/OpenAPI specifications and implementing HATEOAS principles for improved API navigation and discovery.

## üöÄ Quick Start Example

Here's a complete example of how to interact with our Water Intake Tracking API:

### Authentication

First, obtain an access token from Keycloak:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/drinkwater/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'grant_type=password' \
-d 'client_id=drinkwaterapp' \
-d 'username=your-username' \
-d 'password=your-password'
```

You'll receive a response like this:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1...",
  "expires_in": 300,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

### Recording Water Intake

Record a new water intake entry:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8081/users/waterintakes' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
          "dateTimeUTC": "2024-01-26T14:30:00Z",
          "volume": 250,
          "volumeUnit": "ML"
        }'
```

Success response (HTTP 201):

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "dateTimeUTC": "2024-01-26T14:30:00Z",
  "volume": 250,
  "volumeUnit": "ML"
}
```

### Searching Water Intake Records

Search for water intake records with filters:

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8081/users/waterintakes?startDate=2024-01-26T00:00:00Z&endDate=2024-01-26T23:59:59Z&minVolume=200&maxVolume=1000&page=0&size=10&sortField=dateTimeUTC&sortDirection=DESC' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

Success response (HTTP 200):

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "dateTimeUTC": "2024-01-26T14:30:00Z",
      "volume": 250,
      "volumeUnit": "ML"
    }
  ],
  "totalElements": 1,
  "totalPages": 1,
  "pageSize": 10,
  "pageNumber": 0,
  "first": true,
  "last": true
}
```

### Updating a Water Intake Record

Update an existing water intake entry:

```bash
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:8081/users/waterintakes/1' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
          "dateTimeUTC": "2024-01-26T14:30:00Z",
          "volume": 300,
          "volumeUnit": "ML"
        }'
```

Success response (HTTP 200):

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "dateTimeUTC": "2024-01-26T14:30:00Z",
  "volume": 300,
  "volumeUnit": "ML"
}
```

### Deleting a Water Intake Record

Delete a water intake entry:

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:8081/users/waterintakes/1' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

Success response: HTTP 204 (No Content)

### Error Responses

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns detailed error messages:

```json
{
  "type": "https://www.drinkwater.com.br/validation-error",
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "Validation error occurred",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "volume",
      "message": "Volume must be greater than zero"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üß™ Testing

This project includes comprehensive testing capabilities with unit tests, integration tests, code coverage reports, and mutation testing.

### Test Naming Pattern
We follow the `given_when_then` naming pattern for test methods, which helps create clear and descriptive test names:
- `given`: Initial context/preconditions
- `when`: Action or behavior being tested
- `then`: Expected outcome

Example: `givenValidUserData_whenCreateUser_thenReturnsUserResponseDTO()`

### Running Tests

#### Complete Test Suite
Run all unit and integration tests:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify
```

#### Unit Tests
Run only unit tests:
```bash
./mvnw clean test
```

#### Skip Integration Tests
Execute tests while skipping integration tests:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -DskipITs=true
```

#### Skip Unit Tests
Execute tests while skipping unit tests:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -Dsurefire.skip=true
```

### Code Coverage
Generate a detailed code coverage report using JaCoCo:
```bash
./mvnw clean test jacoco:report
```
After execution, you can find the HTML report in `target/site/jacoco/index.html`

### Mutation Testing
Run mutation testing with PIT to evaluate test suite effectiveness:
```bash
./mvnw test-compile org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
```
The mutation testing report will be available at `target/pit-reports/YYYYMMDDHHMI/index.html`

### Test Reports
Test reports are typically found under the `target` directory:
- JaCoCo: `target/site/jacoco/`
- PIT Mutation: `target/pit-reports/`
- Surefire: `target/surefire-reports/`

#### üö® Note: Exact paths may vary depending on your project configuration and build settings.

This documentation now includes complete information about the different types of testing available in the project, how to run them, and where to find the generated reports. The commands for code coverage and mutation testing have been integrated alongside the existing test commands, providing a comprehensive testing guide.
